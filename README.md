# PACMAN
Welcome to the Pacman game repository! This project represents an implementation of the iconic Pacman arcade game developed using Python and various libraries. Its aim is to recreate the nostalgic gaming experience of navigating Pacman through a maze while gobbling up dots and avoiding ghosts. The game's design and functionality stay true to the classic gameplay that has entertained players for decades.
The Pacman game features all the essential elements that make the original game so engaging. Players control Pacman using the arrow keys on their keyboard to navigate him through the maze. As Pacman moves, he consumes dots scattered throughout the maze while avoiding contact with the roaming ghosts. 
# Objective
The primary objective is to clear each maze by eating all the dots without getting caught by the ghosts.
To add excitement and challenge, the game includes power-ups that Pacman can collect. These power-ups temporarily empower Pacman to eat ghosts, turning the tables on his pursuers and allowing players to score extra points. As players progress through the levels, they encounter different maze layouts and challenges, keeping the gameplay dynamic and engaging.
Technologically, the Pacman game is built using Python programming language and leverages several libraries for game development. Pygame serves as the backbone for graphics, sound, and user input, providing the essential framework for creating a fully functional game. NumPy is utilized for array manipulation and mathematical operations, while Matplotlib aids in visualizing game statistics and performance metrics.
Setting up and running the Pacman game locally is straightforward. Players can clone the repository, install the required dependencies using pip, and run the Python script to start the game. Once launched, players can immerse themselves in the classic Pacman experience, navigating through mazes, collecting dots, and outsmarting ghosts to achieve the highest score possible.

Thank you for exploring the Pacman game repository. We hope you enjoy playing this nostalgic arcade classic brought to life with Python!
